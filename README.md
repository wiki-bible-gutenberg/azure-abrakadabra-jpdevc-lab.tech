Product Overview
The A000005 is an Arduino Nanoboard which is a small, breadboard-friendly board based on the ATmega328 (Arduino Nano 3.0) or ATmega168 (Arduino Nano 2.x). It has similar functionality to the Arduino Duemilanove, but in a different package. It lacks only a DC power jack and is instead powered through the Mini-B USB connector. The Nano was designed and is being produced by Gravitech.
